A client wants to open a Pancakes restuarant in Amsterdam and asked to help answering the question, 'Where to open the new restaurant?'. 
The target costumers of the restaurant are mainly tourists and it is therefore important to open the restuarant at a place where a lot of people pass.
To find these popular places, a map of Amsterdam is made that contains the most popular venues.
